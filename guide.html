          <p class="tekst">My name is Łukasz. I was born and have lived all my life in the most characteristic district of the city, which is Bałuty. When I was a teenager, I thought Łódź was a terrible place. However, as the years went by, I fell in love with the city more and more. Since I took up guiding, I've been trying to pass on my knowledge and feelings to others, whether they're residents of Łódź, new visitors to the city or those who are here for the first time. I hope that after a short time with me you will see that Łódź is a cool place to spend more than a few hours or even days in......

            <p class="tekst">I can show you both the most famous and popular places, such as Księży Młyn, Piotrkowska or the Orientarium at the ZOO (I am qualified to do so). We can also go to the areas of Lodz connected with the Jewish community which used to live here in large numbers, visit places which even the inhabitants of Lodz do not go to. We can visit together places associated with the tragic fate of the inhabitants of the Litzmannstadt Ghetto.

          <p class="tekst">School tours are something I am comfortable with and I have done many of them, which allows me to adapt the route and the information content to the age group. We can explore the city on foot, by bus, by car, but also by bike, which will optimise the time spent getting to know Łódź. How about a walk for children? An elephant bath in the Orientarium? Film Łódź? Don't know what revitalisation is? Where to eat well? What is a beetle and what to do with it? Galanta can help you find your way around any of these issues.
