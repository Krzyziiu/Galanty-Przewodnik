    <p>A tour like this is an absolute must! The tour was amazing. Luke shows you the most interesting places in the city. What he says is really interesting and gave us a very good insight into daily life. We are both teachers which is very important for tours. It was the best experience we have had so far! Lukasz is the most friendly, hospitable, inspiring, honest, experienced host you can find in and around Lodz. He let us taste real local food, which was absolutely delicious. In short: if you want to learn more about history, culture and the city, cuisines: this is the one to do! Thanks Luke! :-)   </p>

    <p>Luke did a great job! He felt the passion and is committed to his city. Unfortunately, we were disappointed by the cold temperatures, which affected our tour. Thanks to Luke's patience and understanding we had an amazing tour.</p>

    <p>We had a very interesting walk through Baluty with Luke. He shared a lot of personal experiences, as well as historical facts about his neighborhood and the city, and we could feel his passion for the city! Both for my parents, who had never been to Lodz and Poland before, and for me, living in Lodz for six months. Thank you very much, Lukasz!</p>

    <p>It was a great tour of the culture and history of the city. The guide knew a lot about the subject and told some great stories. While walking around the city, there were so many important details - things that would be hard to see without being shown clearly! I am very happy to have had this excellent tour!</p>

    <p>Luke is a very passionate host with a very personal approach. He will design a tour according to your wishes and guide you through the city. You will also see parts of the city that you won't visit on your own. A guided tour is definitely recommended and worth every penny ðŸ‘Œ</p>

    <p>If you're visiting Lodz, treat yourself and take a tour with Lukasz. He conveys his passion for the history and culture of his city with humour, charm and a flair for interesting anecdotes. When it came to the city's tragic war history, his knowledge of the Holocaust and memorial sites made it an exceptionally enjoyable afternoon. In addition, Luke made the decision to be helpful on a cold, rainy day in January when no one would book a tour. He gave me a lift in his car and saved us from hypothermia. I thank him for this and for passing on his love for the city</p>
